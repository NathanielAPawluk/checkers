# Basic Checkers Program

In its current implementation, this program works for 2 players and can be reset using R.
This will likely gain a computer opponent somewhere down the line when I find the motivation,
as well as a menu to select single/multiplayer modes.

Running the main.py file opens and starts a game. The checkers.py file contains the classes that
are responsible for most of the backend.
